1)JsonEmployee should be a class in a separate file
2)It is good to have separate methods for each separate function to follow SingleResponsibility.
One of the methods could be ReadEmployeeInfo and the other SaveEmployeesInfoToJsonFile. 
3) The main Program class is mostly static so it is very hard to unit test.
I would just create an entry point for my application and have a separate class which has injected interfaces
Something similar to this:

4) also wrap reading/writing operations in using so the file does not appear to be executed by another process and dispose of the operation
5) string str is unnecessary long, I would use stringbuilder here
6) try catch is a must. Operations such as reading and writing can easily break.
